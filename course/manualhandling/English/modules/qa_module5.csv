Question,Extra Info,A,B,C,D,Answer,Correct
"What should you do if you need to carry a load down a steep slope?",,"Roll the items down the slope","Place the items on your shoulders and take it down","Stop and assess if it's safe to carry the items down the slope","Place the items on your shoulder and run down the slope to finish quickly",C,"Correct (C). Stop and assess if it's safe to carry the item/s down the slope. Employees should get help from another worker whenever necessary, if they have to negotiate a slope or ramp. In addition the risk from pushing/pulling on a slope is that the forces needed to push will be greater. Weight limits should not be exceeded when moving loaded trolleys up/down slopes."
"What must your employer do if you have to lift a load?",,"Nothing, it's your responsibility","Provide a risk assessment of the task","Make sure your supervisor watches you while you lift the load","Be present while you lift the load",B,"Correct (B). Provide a risk assessment of the task. A manual handling risk assessment is required when you cannot avoid a manual handling task and there is a risk of injury. It will help in assessing the elements of the operation and assist in deciding suitable controls."
"When lifting a load you should always try to?",,"Divide the load into smaller loads","Put the load on your shoulder","Keep knees straight and bend your back","Lift it with one hand",A,"Correct (A). Divide the load into smaller loads. Or is it possible to purchase items in smaller weights or bags? For example for regular deliveries of materials such as bulk food supplies, chemicals or stationary. If it is not possible, or reasonable, to purchase items in smaller weights or bags, can you separate or breakdown the load into small weights?"
"If you need to move a load while sitting you should always remember that:",,"You can move twice the amount if you're sitting","It doesn't matter as you can move the same amount if you're sitting","You can move less weight than normal if you're sitting","You can move more weight than normal if you're sitting",C,"Correct (C). You can move less weight than normal if you're sitting. Seated workers face particular risks when handling because they cannot use their stronger leg muscles to lift the load. The weight limits are much smaller and the object should be held closer to the body. Where this is not happening, a detailed risk assessment is needed."
"What should you do if you need to lift a load which blocks your front view?",,"Ask a colleague to walk beside you and give instructions","Ask a colleague to help carry the load and ensure you both can see ahead","Ask a colleague to walk in front of you and warn others that you're approaching","Carry on lifting the load because its so large that everyone will see you approaching",B,"Correct (B). Team lifting is sometimes used to reduce manual handling risks, however it needs to be coordinated properly. You should try and make sure that those lifting are around the same height and build. Also you should ensure that one person is responsible for giving instructions and coordinating the activity."
